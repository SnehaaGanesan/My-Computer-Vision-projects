# My-Computer-Vision-work-projects
Contains my implementations of several image processing techniques in Python. The projects use inbuilt libraries solely for loading of images, mathematic calculations, plotting and for displaying results, and not for the core computer vision techniques.


# Notes on 1_CV_Snehaa :
  The project involves generating histogram, pdf, cdf, performing histogram equalization and histogram matching using 2 images, and the corresponding histogram, pdf, cdf plots and the resulting images.

The implementation is in python and uses existing functions solely for mathematical operations and plotting purposes and not for the core image processing, here, generating histogram, pdf, cdf,  histogram equalization, and histogram matching.


# Notes on 2_CV_Snehaa :

The project involves implementing Affine Tranformations, Affine transformation using landmarks, and line detection using hough transform. 


# Notes on 3_Snehaa_Card_Detection :

The goal of the project is to identify playing cards correctly and efficiently. 

Steps involved in the development of the project are : image preprocessing, edge detection to extract the boundaries of the card, and template matching which entails scaling and rotation for a perfect match to the template.

Two approaches were used and their performance compared, the first was using the whole card as templates, and second using the number and the suite of the card and parsing them separately for a 2 step template matching. The latter produced much faster results.
