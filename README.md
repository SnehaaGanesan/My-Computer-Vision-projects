# My-Computer-Vision-work-projects
Contains my implementations of several image processing techniques in Python 


Notes on 1_CV_Snehaa :

  The project involves generating histogram, pdf, cdf, performing histogram equalization and histogram matching using 2 images, and the corresponding histogram, pdf, cdf plots and the resulting images.

The implementation is in python and uses existing functions solely for mathematical operations and plotting purposes and not for the core image processing, here, generating histogram, pdf, cdf,  histogram equalization, and histogram matching.
